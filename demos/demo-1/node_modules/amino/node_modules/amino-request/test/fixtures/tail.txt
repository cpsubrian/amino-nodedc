'It  is  a long tail, certainly said Alice, looking down
with wonder at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it
sad?'  And  she  kept  on  puzzling  about  it while the
Mouse was speaking, so that her idea  of  the  tale  was
something like this:- 'Fury said to a
                   mouse, That
                     he met in the
                          house, "Let
                              us both go
                                 to law: I
                                 will prosec-
                                  cute you --
                                Come, I'll
                             take no de-
                         nial:  We
                     must  have
                 the trial;
               For really
             this morn-
           ing I've
          nothing
         to do."
          Said the
           mouse to
            the cur,
             "Such   a
               trial, dear
                   sir, With
                      no  jury
                        or judge,
                            would

                   breath."
                 "I'll be
               judge,
            I'll be
          jury,"
         said
        cun-
        ning
          old
           Fury;
             "I'll
               try
                 the
                  whole
                   cause,
